# GraphStation 📸🕸️

GraphStation is a lightweight, non-linear photo browser and gallery designed specifically for Synology NAS users. Instead of navigating rigid folder structures, GraphStation allows you to explore your photo collection through its underlying graph of relationships—connecting people, locations, objects, and time.

## 🌟 Features

- **Graph-Based Navigation:** Pivot through your collection by clicking on metadata "neighbors" (Persons, Locations, AI-detected Objects).
- **Lightweight Architecture:** Designed to run on resource-constrained hardware (e.g., Synology NAS with 2GB RAM).
- **Native Integration:** Utilizes Synology's internal session authentication and thumbnail APIs for seamless performance.
- **POLE+O Data Model:** Built on a Labeled Property Graph (LPG) schema using [Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/).

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before setting up GraphStation, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Synology NAS:** Running **DSM 7.x** with **Synology Photos** installed.
- **Web Station:** Installed and configured on your Synology NAS (required for hosting the frontend and Python API).
- **SSH Access:** Enabled on your NAS for automated deployment.
- **Memgraph:** A running instance of Memgraph (typically via Docker on the NAS).
- **Metadata Sync:** Data must be synced using [synofoto-graph-sync](https://github.com/thtesche/synofoto-graph-sync).

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Database:** Memgraph (Docker-based) for high-performance graph traversal.
- **Backend:** Lightweight Python (FastAPI/Flask) running bare-metal on Synology Web Station.
- **Frontend:** React SPA (Static) hosted on Synology Web Station.

## 🚀 Deployment Options

Currently, GraphStation is optimized for hosting all components directly on the Synology NAS. Support for hosting components on an external machine via Docker is planned for the future.

### Option A: Hosting on Synology NAS (Web Station)

For detailed setup and deployment instructions, see our [NAS Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md).

1. **Local Setup:** Run `./setup_local.sh` on your local development machine to create the `.env` configuration file and install frontend dependencies (requires Node.js/npm).
2. **Prepare Memgraph:** Run Memgraph in Docker on your NAS.
3. **Sync Metadata:** Use [synofoto-graph-sync](https://github.com/thtesche/synofoto-graph-sync) to populate the graph from Synology Photos.
4. **Deploy Backend & Frontend:** Run `./deploy.sh` to automatically build the React app and deploy it along with the Python API to your NAS.

### 🐳 Option B: Hosting on an External Machine (Docker)

If you prefer to host GraphStation on a separate Linux server, Mini-PC, or cloud instance, you can use our Docker Compose setup.

For manual deployment steps, see our [Docker Deployment Guide](docs/deployment_docker.md).

### 💻 Local Development

To run the application locally for development:
1. Ensure you have run `./setup_local.sh` and configured your `.env` file.
2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
